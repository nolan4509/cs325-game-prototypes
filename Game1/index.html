<h2>Space Cowboy</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Use your mouse to move the cowboy around to avoid being hit by asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Cowboys and Asteroids/Space
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Action
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have a fun time since they will have no way of knowing from which direction and how fast each asteroid will be traveling, which will make it more challenging.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player may use their mouse to move the cowboy around in order to avoid colliding with random asteroids flying across the screen. Currently, the ability to click and shoot the asteroids is not in the game prototype, but is planned for the future. If you collide with an asteroid, you lose.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Collisions and working with spritesheets.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The acceleration and speed of the cowboy are set in a way that makes him a little bit more difficult to control if you are just throwing your mouse all over the place to dodge the asteroids, which adds a little more fun and challenge to the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in space, and you are the last space cowboy, a cowboy with the ability to breathe and fly around in space, however there's an asteroid field coming your way, and you must dodge them all to make it through.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game attempts to attract a younger audience, such as 8-10.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
0-2 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Varrying how fast the players move their mouse around for different situations and the spacing between the asteroids as they come.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Since I didn't realize we were allowed to borrow code from examples until it was too late, all the code in my game was written by me. I did explore examples to learn how to use phaser, such as reading spritesheets examples, but the code itself was then written by me trying to make sure I didn't copy it.
