<h2>Le Labyrinthe de L'obscurite</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You must navigate through the dark maze with limited visibility in order to find the hidden treasure.</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who glows in the dark.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Keyboard
Randomness: No randomness
Genre: Overhead, puzzle, side scroller (maybe?)
Play Style: Explorer, achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have a fun challenge trying to navigate through the maze with an exciting twist of only being able to see a 
short distance around themselves due to their ability to glow in the dark!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
TThe player will use the arrow keys to navigate around the maze.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Tilemaps, graphics and masking, bitmapdata from tileset data (not going well xD)
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Currently there are a limited amount of features with this game. I spent the majority of my time trying to adjust the game world scale in order to get
the effect I wanted with limited visibility, but as Professor Gingold and I both noticed, it is apparently a known and unsolved issue with scaling the game world causing collision issues all across the board. There are a couple of workarounds I am planning on trying for my iteration, but will require me to recreate the map of my game entirely which is why I didn't have the time to implement that in this game, so instead I simply made the window size smaller. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is certainly more abstract, and doesn't necessarily have a specific setting. You are an great explorer due to your ability to glow in the dark, and you have finally discovered a famous maze that according to legend holds a very large treasure.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You have discovered a famous maze that according to legend holds a very large treasure. Being the explorer you are, you decide to wander in hoping to best the maze and claim the treasure for your own. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Young children
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1-3 Minutes (Hard to guess since I made the maze and therefor know it like the back of my hand)
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to try and create the map of the maze in their head to successfully navigate it without backtracking over and over.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/GMU-CS325/cs325-game-prototypes/tree/master/template-gamestate-functional">Phaser Functional Gamestate Template</a></li>
<li>This game most closely resembles a maze crawler with a twist of limited vision.
