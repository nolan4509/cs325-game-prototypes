<h2>Le Labyrinthe de L'obscurite</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You must navigate through the dark maze with limited visibility in order to find the hidden treasure.</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who glows in the dark.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Keyboard
Randomness: a lot of randomness with enemy bat spawns
Genre: Platformer, overhead, shooter
Play Style: Explorer, achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have a fun time with this almost top-down zelda-like game, and will enjoy giant static
explosions when killing the bats. It's also nice to walk around the map.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can use the left and right arrow keys to move in the left and right directions, as well as the up and 
down keys to move up and down. The player can use the space bar to shoot a fireball. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Spritesheets, collisions, tilemaps, losing when enemies reach out of bounds, killing enemy sprites, game states
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I was a lot more successful with this game than my last, I got almost everything I hoped for working. You are 
able to control the player using the arrow keys, and shoot fireballs in different directions based on the diretion
you are facing using the spacebar. The player also obviously can't walk across water, over the cliff, or through any 
trees. You CAN go over the bridge, try it out once you kill all of the bats!!!
I have a group of enemies that all move and are animated. 
The one thing that I wasnt able to get working, was the explosion animation when you destroy a bat. The bat dissapears
and the explosion first image takes its place, but it doesn't actually play the animation, no matter what I tried..hence the code 
around there looks pretty messy.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is certainly more abstract, and doesn't necessarily have a specific setting. You are a mage and 
a farmer, and want to preserve your home and crops.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You exited your house to begin watering the plants and see there is an army of bats headed towards you, 
you must preserve your home!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Young children
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5-20 seconds
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players must use quick thinking to determine how to shoot all of the bats before they reach the top.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/GMU-CS325/cs325-game-prototypes/tree/master/template-gamestate-functional">Phaser Functional Gamestate Template</a></li>
<li>This game most closely resembles a mix between a tower defense game and a top-down zelda game.
