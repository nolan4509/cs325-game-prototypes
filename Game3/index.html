<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are the hero and will stop at nothing to rescue the princess from the boss on the other side of the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who will do whatever it takes
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Keyboard
Randomness: deterministic
Genre: Platformer, side-scroller, shooter?
Play Style: Explorer, achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have a fun time with this almost mario-like platformer game and will have a good laugh when they run into the boss
and dissapear xD
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can use the left and right arrow keys to move in the left and right directions. The player can use
up arrow key to jump, and the space bar to shoot a fireball. Details about items that weren't successfully implemented
in the prototype can be found in the features section.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Spritesheets, collisions, tilemaps, dying out of bounds, killing enemy sprites, game states
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
For one I spent hours trying to get the tilemap and hero interaction on that map to work. I have also made
it so you can shoot fireballs from your player. Unfortunately I believe I set a slightly too ambitious goal for my game.
My hope was to have the boss be shooting fireballs with a angle variance at you, the hero, and you would shoot fireballs back 
at him once you made it across, and you would have to dodge his fire and hit him in order to then safely get by to where
the princess would be standing. I couldn't get the collisions between the fireball and the boss to work, so all you need to do is run into him,
but then the player also dissapears for some reason. And, I can't get the princess to show up, at this point I'm just too frustrated
to keep trying, but overall I'm happy with what I did accomoplish with this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is certainly more abstract, and doesn't necessarily have a specific setting. You are a mage who has 
mastered the art of the fireball, and are the only one willing to stand up to the bossman to save the princess.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The princess has been taken away by the evil bossman. Naturally, you are the only one who is willing to stand
up to the bossman, so you must do everything in your power to save the princess.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Young children
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
0-2 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to time their jumps right in order to safely make it across the dangerous world.
</li>
